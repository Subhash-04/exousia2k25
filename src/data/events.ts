    title: 'Circuit Carnival',
    description: 'DAY-1 Event.. \n\nThis is a two-player competitive game where each pair of players navigates a board using principles of electrical engineering. Instead of numbers, custom dice feature electrical components like resistors and capacitors, each with a specific value that determines their move. Landing on a "short circuit" square sends them back, while landing on a "strategic pathway" allows them to advance. The pair that reaches the end of the board first wins. This event is a fun and engaging way to test knowledge of electrical components in an exciting, hands-on format.',
